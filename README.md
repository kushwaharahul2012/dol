# 🚀 DevOps Engineering Launchpad — 15-Day Sprint

Welcome to my 15-day DevOps execution sprint.  
This is not tutorial tourism. This is practical, real-world DevOps skill building + interview mindset sharpening.

## 🎯 Mission

Build real DevOps muscle memory, fix panic brain in interviews, and practice actual ops tasks end-to-end.

## 🕐 Time Commitment

2 hours per day  
(1h hands-on + 30m concepts + 30m interview training)

## 📂 Structure

Each day I will push:

- Concept summary (in my own words)
- Commands, logs, and troubleshooting
- One interview answer
- Scripts/configs
- Daily reflection

## ✅ Daily Checklist

Every day I will document:

- What I learned
- Commands I ran (with output)
- Troubleshooting process
- One interview Q&A
- Reflection (1–2 lines)

Commit message format:

## 🔒 Rules

- Zero excuses, zero skipping days
- No reinstalling tools unless required
- Break → Debug → Understand → Fix → Document
- Copy-paste = cheating myself; thinking = winning

## 🎤 My Why

To become a confident DevOps engineer who can operate, troubleshoot, script, explain, and deliver under pressure — not freeze in interviews.

Let’s build execution > insecurity.
